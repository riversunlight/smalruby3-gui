# smalruby3-gui
#### Smalruby3 GUI is a set of React components that comprise the interface for creating and running Smalruby 3.0 projects. It forked from [LLK/scratch-gui](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-gui) .

[![Introduce Smalruby 3 based Scratch 3.0](https://img.youtube.com/vi/UNkinwLk6uQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkinwLk6uQ)

## Installation
This requires you to have Git and Node.js installed.

In your own node environment/application:
```bash
npm install https://github.com/smalruby/smalruby3-gui.git
```
If you want to edit/play yourself:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/smalruby/smarluby3-gui.git
cd smarluby3-gui
npm install
```

**You may want to add `--depth=1` to the `git clone` command because there are some [large files in the git repository history](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-gui/issues/5140).**

## Getting started
Running the project requires Node.js to be installed.

## Running
Open a Command Prompt or Terminal in the repository and run:
```bash
npm start
```
Then go to [http://localhost:8601/](http://localhost:8601/) - the playground outputs the default GUI component

## Testing
### Documentation

You may want to review the documentation for [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/api.html) and [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/) as you write your tests.

See [jest cli docs](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/cli.html#content) for more options.

### Running tests

*NOTE: If you're a windows user, please run these scripts in Windows `cmd.exe`  instead of Git Bash/MINGW64.*

Before running any tests, make sure you have run `npm install` from this (scratch-gui) repository's top level.

#### Main testing command

To run linter, unit tests, build, and integration tests, all at once:
```bash
npm test
```

#### Running unit tests

To run unit tests in isolation:
```bash
npm run test:unit
```

To run unit tests in watch mode (watches for code changes and continuously runs tests):
```bash
npm run test:unit -- --watch
```

You can run a single file of integration tests (in this example, the `button` tests):

```bash
$(npm bin)/jest --runInBand test/unit/components/button.test.jsx
```

#### Running integration tests

Integration tests use a headless browser to manipulate the actual html and javascript that the repo
produces. You will not see this activity (though you can hear it when sounds are played!).

Note that integration tests require you to first create a build that can be loaded in a browser:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then, you can run all integration tests:

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

Or, you can run a single file of integration tests (in this example, the `backpack` tests):

```bash
$(npm bin)/jest --runInBand test/integration/backpack.test.js
```

If you want to watch the browser as it runs the test, rather than running headless, use:

```bash
USE_HEADLESS=no $(npm bin)/jest --runInBand test/integration/backpack.test.js
```

## Troubleshooting

### Ignoring optional dependencies

When running `npm install`, you can get warnings about optionsl dependencies:

```
npm WARN optional Skipping failed optional dependency /chokidar/fsevents:
npm WARN notsup Not compatible with your operating system or architecture: fsevents@1.2.7
```

You can suppress them by adding the `no-optional` switch:

```
npm install --no-optional
```

### Resolving dependencies

When installing for the first time, you can get warnings which need to be resolved:

```
npm WARN eslint-config-scratch@5.0.0 requires a peer of babel-eslint@^8.0.1 but none was installed.
npm WARN eslint-config-scratch@5.0.0 requires a peer of eslint@^4.0 but none was installed.
npm WARN scratch-paint@0.2.0-prerelease.20190318170811 requires a peer of react-intl-redux@^0.7 but none was installed.
npm WARN scratch-paint@0.2.0-prerelease.20190318170811 requires a peer of react-responsive@^4 but none was installed.
```

You can check which versions are available:

```
npm view react-intl-redux@0.* version
```

You will neet do install the required version:

```
npm install  --no-optional --save-dev react-intl-redux@^0.7
```

The dependency itself might have more missing dependencies, which will show up like this:

```
user@machine:/path/to/smalruby3-gui$ npm install  --no-optional --save-dev react-intl-redux@^0.7
smalruby-gui@0.9.1 /path/to/smalruby3-gui
├── react-intl-redux@0.7.0
└── UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY react-responsive@5.0.0
```

You will need to install those as well:

```
npm install  --no-optional --save-dev react-responsive@^5.0.0
```
